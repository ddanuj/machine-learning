# CSCI 567 Machine Learning

## Programming Assignment 4

### Tasks
In this Programming Set you are asked to implement K-means clustering to identify main clusters
in the data, use the discovered centroid of cluster for classification and implement Gaussian Mixture
Models to learn generative a model p(xjz) of the data. Specifically, you will
- Implement K-means clustering algorithm to identify clusters in a two-dimensional toy-dataset.
- Implement image compression using K-means clustering algorithm.
- Implement classification using the centroids identified by clustering.
- Implement Gaussian Mixture Models to learn a generative model and generate samples from a mixture distribution.
